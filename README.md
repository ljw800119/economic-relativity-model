Repository for the Economic Relativity Model (ERM) to analyze economic crises and systemic behavior.
This paper establishes the foundational structure of the Economic Relativity Model (ERM), a parsimonious structural framework for modeling economic output under systemic friction and incentive constraints. The ERM formalizes output as a nonlinear function of potential production capacity, irreducible costs, price pressure, and institutional inefficiency, yielding a general law of constrained production applicable across micro, meso, and macro economic scales.

By introducing the cost–profit ratio as a dimensionless boundary variable, the model captures endogenous transitions between growth, stagnation, and contraction regimes without reliance on equilibrium assumptions or exogenous shock primitives. The framework provides a unified formalism linking behavioral expectations, structural efficiency, and output dynamics, offering a transparent alternative to parameter-heavy macroeconomic models.
